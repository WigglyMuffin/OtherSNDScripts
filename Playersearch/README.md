The Playersearch script uses an external functions file, instructions to install:

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following plugins installed and enabled:

- Lifestream (If using world hopping setting)
- Something Need Doing (Expanded Edition)

## Installation

1. Verify all required plugins are installed and enabled.
2. Download the latest vac_functions files from [SNDScripts](https://github.com/WigglyMuffin/SNDScripts/blob/main/vac_functions.lua).
3. Place the vac_functions file in your SND config folder (`%appdata%\XIVLauncher\pluginConfigs\SomethingNeedDoing`). You can place them elsewhere but you will need to adjust the `load_functions_file_location` line to point to the correct path.
4. Download the latest Playersearch script file 
5. Import Playersearch into your SND environment (`/snd` and import the script).
