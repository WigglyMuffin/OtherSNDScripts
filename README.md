A place where scripts or projects have no home, and not to be considered supported/maintained.

### Playersearch
Uses the player search function to find all online players on a given world, useful for plugins such as Playerscope. Has multiple settings for automation.

The Playersearch script uses an external functions file, instructions to install:

1. Download the latest vac_functions files from [SNDScripts](https://github.com/WigglyMuffin/SNDScripts/blob/main/vac_functions.lua).
2. Place the vac_functions file in your SND config folder (`%appdata%\XIVLauncher\pluginConfigs\SomethingNeedDoing`). You can place them elsewhere but you will need to adjust the `load_functions_file_location` line to point to the correct path.
